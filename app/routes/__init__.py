# Import Flask Blueprint objects from respective modules
from .auth_routes import auth_bp
from .waste_routes import waste_bp

# Optionally, you can organize the imports further if needed.
# For example:
# from . import auth_routes
# from . import waste_routes

# You can define any initialization logic here if necessary.
# This file is often left empty if there's no additional setup required.
